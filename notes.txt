NEXT TO DO:

- make user card have pokemon images based on selection
- organize where pictures will render after user selects choice
- look into more efficient way of calling array files (bundle?);
- add icon in input box








COOL IDEAS TO ADD AT END:


pokemon cries when you choose that pokemon

pokeball cursor for hovering over pokemon names in dropdown

change background color of dropdown li hover to type color





WHAT DID I LEARN
you can use queryselectors on elements
you can access globally established variables in functions using bracket notation on window, ie: window[variable]
I thought making the dropdown would be as easy as making a select element and modifying something minor to make a search/filter bar.
that wasnt the case. Looked up how to do it, found semanticUI, but i didn't want to install a whole package just to achieve this.
I noticed the way it worked though was they had predefined classes that appeared to be triggering javascript. So I asked XpertAI about what approach I could do to achieve the same.
